# Learn graphics for theoretical gui with rust

Examples of GUI element graphics, written and illustrated with pictures to better understand the algorithm for drawing an element in the user interface.


## Features

- Examples using different libraries or algorithm to implement the same operation
- Detailed explanation with pictures suitable for beginners and professionals as well
- Additional resources and external links for further information

## roadmap
We currently use two graphics libraries: [skia(rust)](https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia) and [tiny-skia](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/tiny-skia).
In the future, examples will be developed for other libraries, but the algorithm will not differ much.

There are levels of difficulty (the expected difficulty of writing the required example in terms of knowing the appropriate algorithm):
##### Easy: 
It can be written once you know how to work with the graphical library.
##### Difficult:
In addition to the previous requirement, it requires skill, resourcefulness, and some mathematical knowledge to know how to reach the required algorithm.
